				<p class="celebrity-caption">
					Jim Carrey easily makes the short list of history's most influential
					comedians, but in an interview with 60 Minutes, the funnyman shocked a
					lot of people when he acknowledged he has spent much of his life
					dealing with depression. After the second of his two failed marriages,
					Carrey sought the help of a psychiatrist who prescribed him Prozac.
					Though Carrey admits the antidepressant helped him out of an initial
					jam, he also realized that he couldn't be one of those who stay on the
					drug forever. "I had to get off [Prozac] at a certain point," said
					Carrey. "You need to get out of bed every day and say that life is
					good. That's what I did, although at times it was very difficult for
					me." Carrey credits a healthy diet and natural supplements for his
					improved mental health.

				<h2 class="celebrity-heading">Ellen DeGeneres</h2>
				<p class="celebrity-caption">
					In 1998, shortly after she revealed that she was gay, Ellen
					Degeneres's popular sitcom was axed. "Everything that I ever feared
					happened to me," Degeneres later recalled. "I lost my show. I've been
					attacked like hell. I went from making a lot of money on a sitcom to
					making no money. When I walked out of the studio after five years of
					working so hard, knowing I had been treated so disrespectfully for no
					other reason than I was gay, I just went into this deep, deep
					depression." But the comedienne persevered, continuing in the
					industry, and ultimately finding acceptance and happiness with an
					Emmy-winning talk show and an unforgettable turn as a fish with
					amnesia in Pixar's Finding Nemo franchise.

				<h2 class="celebrity-heading">Johnny Depp</h2>
				<p class="celebrity-caption">
					Actor Johnny Depp may be a chameleon on screen, but watch him during
					any interview, and you'll see only a man whose facial expressions,
					droopy posture, and mumbled words give away what was once a big
					secret: Depp suffers from severe anxiety. Indeed, the actor's anxiety
					has been a major source of depression and unease, so much so that Depp
					has access to therapists at all times, even on film sets, who help
					advise him on how best to deal with his anxiety and keep it from
					dragging him into severe depression.

				<h2 class="celebrity-heading">Eminem</h2>
				<p class="celebrity-caption">
					In his memoir, The Way I Am, Eminem goes into detail about his battle
					with depression more than a decade ago. Though the rapper grew up
					through tough circumstances, in 2006 he found himself reeling after
					the murder of his close friend and D12 member Proof. His continuously
					rocky relationship with his ex-wife wasn't helping either. Eminem
					recalled, "I have never felt so much pain in my life. It was tough for
					me to even get out of bed and I had days when I couldn't walk, let
					alone write a rhyme."
